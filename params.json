Includes scripts for distribution as well as all the required libaries and binaries for Löve2D 0.8","body":"# Löve2D Project Preset\r\n\r\nThis is a small helper repository to get you started coding a nice game with Löve2D.\r\n\r\nIt was originally wrote by [opatut](https://github.com/opatut). [I](https://github.com/alessandrofac93) rewrote most of this and modernized all.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Makefile and Bash scripts are not good for Windows, don't you try to feed them to the nasty Microsoft stuff. For Linux only!\r\n* You should have Löve2D installed on your system, so you don't have to build the binary package all the time for testing\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nThe following make targets are available:\r\n\r\n    clean:              clears all generated data\r\n    build:              packages the data and sources into ```game.love```\r\n    run:                runs ```love game.love``` for you\r\n    package-all:        creates all binary packages into ```pkg/```\r\n    package-<platform>: generates binary package for one of the supported platforms\r\n\r\nJust type ```make``` to perform the **build** and **run** targets.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nPut your data in the ```data/``` folder, and your sources into ```src/```. Make sure to adjust ```src/config.lua```.\r\n\r\nThis project uses stable and powerful libraries.
